## Overview

Boosted "back to top" provides a way to get back to the top of the page using a simple link. It's built only with HTML and CSS, meaning you don't need any JavaScript. It only requires a `.back-to-top` wrapper and a `.back-to-top-link`, at the end of your `body`— just before your scripts.

For accessibility purposes, back-to-top link contains a `.visually-hidden` text content and a `data-bs-label` attribute— whose **value should match hidden text content** to make sure it's usable with speech recognition software. The `data-bs-label` attribute content is displayed in a `::before` pseudo-element thanks to the `attr()` CSS function.

We also recommend using a `nav` wrapper —alongside an accurate `aria-label`— to ease discoverability through landmarks.

Make sure you leave enough space between the back-to-top link and the bottom of the viewport to:
- prevent the component being overlapped by bottom navigation bar on mobile and notification tooltips for Windows users,
- avoid proximity with system interactive areas, which could lead to accidentally activating an adjacent target.

### Smooth scroll

Smooth scrolling does not depend on this component. It's turned on only when the user has **not** explicitly signaled that they’d prefer reduced motion (i.e. where `prefers-reduced-motion: no-preference`) through the `scroll-behavior` property. [Read more about `prefers-reduced-motion` in our accessibility page]({{< docsref "/getting-started/accessibility#reduced-motion" >}}).

## Example

<div class="bd-example">
  <nav aria-label="Standard back to top example" class="back-to-top position-static ps-5 ms-5">
    <a href="#top" class="back-to-top-link btn btn-icon btn-secondary position-relative top-0" data-bs-label="Back to top">
      <span class="visually-hidden">Back to top</span>
    </a>
  </nav>
</div>
{{< example show_preview="false" >}}
<nav aria-label="Back to top" class="back-to-top">
  <a href="#top" class="back-to-top-link btn btn-icon btn-secondary" data-bs-label="Back to top">
    <span class="visually-hidden">Back to top</span>
  </a>
</nav>
{{< /example >}}

### Define a target

Since we're using a link, **you need a valid target**. We recommend adding an anchor link at the beginning of your markup, like so: `<a id="top"></a>`.
You may use another `id`, but if you're using a fixed header you'll need to override our `$back-to-top-target-id` variable to ensure it won't overlap content after scrolling up.

### Always visible

Add `.position-fixed` utility to your `.back-to-top-link` to make your back-to-top link persistent.

{{< example show_preview="false" >}}
<nav aria-label="Fixed back to top example" class="back-to-top">
  <a href="#top" class="back-to-top-link position-fixed btn btn-icon btn-secondary" data-bs-label="Back to top">
    <span class="visually-hidden">Back to top</span>
  </a>
</nav>
{{< /example >}}

### Label inside

Drop the `data-bs-label` attribute and the `<span class="visually-hidden">` and use [spacing utilities]({{< docsref "/utilities/spacing" >}}) to fine tune your button.

<div class="bd-example">
  <nav aria-label="Label inside back to top example" class="back-to-top position-static">
    <a href="#top" class="back-to-top-link position-static btn btn-secondary px-3">Back to top</a>
  </nav>
</div>
{{< example show_preview="false" >}}
<nav aria-label="Back to top" class="back-to-top">
  <a href="#top" class="back-to-top-link btn btn-secondary px-3">Back to top</a>
</nav>
{{< /example >}}

### Icon only

Use a `title` attribute instead of `data-bs-label` to ensure a visible label is still provided on demand for sighted users.

<div class="bd-example">
  <nav aria-label="Icon only back to top example" class="back-to-top position-static">
    <a href="#top" class="back-to-top-link position-static btn btn-icon btn-secondary" title="Back to top">
      <span class="visually-hidden">Back to top</span>
    </a>
  </nav>
</div>
{{< example show_preview="false" >}}
<nav aria-label="Back to top" class="back-to-top">
  <a href="#top" class="back-to-top-link btn btn-icon btn-secondary" title="Back to top">
    <span class="visually-hidden">Back to top</span>
  </a>
</nav>
{{< /example >}}

## Sass

### Options

Back to top link can be customized in a few ways: either making it appear after more or less vertical scrolling, modify its offset from the bottom right corner, etc.

<table class="table">

      </td>
      <td><code>100vh</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>$back-to-top-target-id</code></td>
      <td>
        Target's <code>id</code>, used to apply <code>scroll-margin-top</code> when anchor is active.
      </td>
      <td><code>"top"</code></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td><code>$back-to-top-offset</code></td>
      <td>
        Base offset, used to place "back to top" link in the bottom right corner of the page.
